	<td><p id="textone">The Covid-19 crisis will be remembered as the catalyst for a quantum leap in digital adoption for companies everywhere on the planet. Management consulting company McKinsey reports most companies have significantly accelerated digitization, responding 20-25 times faster than thought possible before the pandemic, to harness digital channels and reach audiences.  This pandemic threw the entire human race into their homes for most of the year. However, it seems that gaming industry found the perfect setting to thrive in a pandemic year. Time spent on online gaming increased during the lockdown, as people turned to online gaming to connect and interact globally. <br>
<br>
Sony launched the PS5 in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions on November 12 and on November 19 for the rest of the world. 

Also, its competitor Xbox Series X got released by Microsoft a little early on November 10 in 2020. It was a really big competition between the 2 consoles given that they had 8k streaming and a lot of similarities as well.
<br><br>
Gamers became crazy about this and soon these gaming consoles were being bought by thousands of people and got sold out in minutes. 

From January to March, according to data from GameAnalytics, the number of mobile gamers grew from 1.2 billion people to 1.75 billion per month, marking an increase of 46%. Drawing on internal data, the analytics tool provider reports the total amount of playtime hit a peak of over 90 million hours in the last ten days of March, 62% higher than the first ten days of January.

<h3>The Success of Ludo King</h3>
<table>
	<td><p id="textone">Several Indians turned to the online version of the popular board game, Ludo this year.
<br>
Ludo King was launched in 2016 but became a quarantine sensation in India after the government announced a strict lockdown in March. The game was one of the top five most installed games in April, according to data by Sensor Tower.
Despite the fact that the game is old fashioned as compared with the games available today, Ludo King crossed 100 million downloads. It was ranked No.1 in the top free games section in Play Store and App Store.

As Ludo is a childhood game for many, familiarity and emotional connection rekindled people’s interest in the game.

<h1>Online Movie Streaming</h1>
<table>
	<td><p id="textone">Video streaming platforms in India, which are now catering to viewers locked up at home due to the covid pandemic, have seen a 60%-80% spike in their paid subscribers, with a few big players even doubling numbers by the end of the year. Media and entertainment industry experts say OTT (over-the-top) streaming players have made the most of the opportunity in a country like India known to relish free content. The platforms have lured viewers by dishing out original and acquired shows and films, offering reasonably priced packages, often bundled with telcos.

<table><br><br>
	<td><p id="textone">Due to Covid-19, many movies were released through OTT platforms as the cinemas and movie halls were closed. Platforms have understood that big-screen owners in the country are still few and most are turning to their smartphones to watch content. For instance, American streaming services such as Netflix, which started with a Rs499 monthly plan, soon moved to a mobile-only subscription priced at Rs199 last year, followed by a Rs349 plan launched in July that makes high definition (HD) content available for mobile phones, laptops and tablets, but not television screens. Amazon, which earlier only offered an annual subscription of Rs999, rolled out the monthly Rs129 plan a couple of months into its launch in India.
