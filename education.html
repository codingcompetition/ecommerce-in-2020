	<td><p id="textone"> 2020 was a year of change, adaptation, adoption, and evolvement even in the world of education. Having been hit by unprecedented times, schools and colleges were unsure about opening their premises which caused a disruption to the academic schedule and hindered the students’ learning graph.Teachers also had to adapt to new pedagogical concepts and modes of delivery of teaching, for which they may not have been trained.
<br>
		<br><br>While the educational community have made concerted efforts to maintain learning continuity during this period, children and students have had to rely more on their own resources to continue learning remotely through the Internet, television or radio.

As more and more institutes moved to this model, they did not have to invest heavily in a suite of new tools as video-conferencing tools such as Zoom and Teams and online-learning platforms like Amity Online have been implemented to help support the shift to online learning.</p>

	<td> <p id="texttwo">Needless to say, the pandemic has transformed the centuries-old, chalk–talk teaching model into one driven by technology.  As we move ahead in 2021, online will continue to be an integral part of the education model in India. Even though we have got vaccines for Covid-19, the education institutes will look at including digital learning in their teaching model to maintain the status quo.

		<p id="textone">There are also many websites that are dedicated to giving good quality courses at reasonable prices like Udemy and Skillshare. They also were used a lot to create courses by people that lost jobs in order to earn money. They work well as a tutorial platform for people looking to learn new skills. They have been so attractive to so many people because they don't need to be a professional to use it. Several of the courses on Udemy and skillshare are broken down into categories so that everybody can get a feel for something.
